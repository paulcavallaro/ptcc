# ptcc - A C11 Compiler in C++17

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulcavallaro/ptcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulcavallaro/ptcc)

This is for my own personal enjoyment of writing a C11 compiler. If others find it useful for teaching or learning, that would make me happy, but is not a primary goal of this project.
